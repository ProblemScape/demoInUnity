STEP 3: Enter instruction here: Divide by 2
STEP 1: Enter instruction here: Each paintball is 2 ruby. One shooter is 35 rubies

STEP 1: Enter instruction here: Each paintball is 2 ruby. One shooter is 35 rubies
Each emerald is equal to 5 rubies

STEP 1: Enter instruction here: Each paintball is 2 ruby. One shooter is 35 rubies
Each emerald is equal to 5 rubies

STEP 1: Enter instruction here: Each paintball is 2 ruby. One shooter is 35 rubies
Each emerald is equal to 5 rubies
So 12 emeralds is 60 rubies
Each shooter costs 35 rubies
I have 66-35 = 31 rubies left
Since each paintball costs 2 rubies, I can get 15 paintballs
